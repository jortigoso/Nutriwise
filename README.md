# Welcome to Nutriwise! üåø

Nutriwise is a fact-checking system that verifies dietary and nutritional claims using a curated database of scientific articles and educational books. It provides accurate, multilingual responses grounded in evidence from PubMed abstracts and nutrition literature.

## 1. Features

## ‚úÖ System Capabilities

This application implements a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) fact-checking system** designed to automatically assess the truthfulness of user-submitted statements using a curated document corpus (e.g., PubMed, Wikipedia, academic articles). The system fulfills the following functional requirements:

- **Verifies factual statements** using evidence retrieved from the knowledge base and assessed by a large language model (LLM).
- **Provides justifications** for its answers by citing relevant source documents and excerpts from the corpus.
- **Does not fabricate answers**: when the system lacks sufficient evidence to verify a claim, it clearly responds with:  
  **‚ÄúI'm sorry, I do not have enough information in the corpus to verify this claim.‚Äù**
- **Supports multilingual interaction**: responses are generated in the same language as the user‚Äôs question (supports English, Spanish, French, German, Italian).

## ‚ú® Additional Features

To enhance usability, performance, and transparency, the system also includes:

- **Local LLM integration** via Ollama (e.g., `qwen2:0.5b`) to generate reliable, context-aware answers.
- **Hybrid document retrieval** combining FAISS (dense vector search) and BM25 (sparse keyword-based retrieval) for improved relevance.
- **Automatic translation** of queries and responses using pre-trained Helsinki-NLP models for seamless multilingual support.
- **Answer summarization**: generates concise, informative summaries using prompt-engineered LLM instructions.
- **Confidence scoring** based on a combination of BERTScore, cosine similarity, and detection of vague expressions.
- **Evaluation module**: includes benchmarking tools to compare models and settings using metrics like ROUGE-L, Recall@k, BERT F1, and latency.
- **Bias reduction heuristics** in translation, e.g., neutralizing gendered phrasing when translating back from non-English queries.
- **Includes a web-based user interface** that allows users to input questions and receive real-time answers with sources and confidence metrics.

## 2. Implementation

### Dataset üßæ

The dataset consists of:

- Over **20,000 scientific abstracts** from PubMed filtered for human nutrition relevance.
- **15 educational nutrition books**, segmented by pages and converted to `.txt` format.

All texts were preprocessed for uniform structure and clean integration.

### Vector Database üõ¢Ô∏è

- **FAISS** is used for semantic search with 384-dimensional dense vectors.
- **BM25Okapi** is integrated for sparse keyword matching.
- Document segmentation is done by page; top 20 chunks are retrieved and top 5 are re-ranked.
- Cosine similarity threshold of 0.3 ensures relevant retrievals.

### Models üß†

Nutriwise integrates several models:

- `paraphrase-MiniLM-L6-v2` for embeddings.
- `qwen2:0.5b` (Ollama) for local answer generation.
- `Helsinki-NLP` for multilingual translation.
- `fastText lid.176.bin` (Facebook) for language detection.
- `BERTScore` for evaluating answer quality.
